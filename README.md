I was always wondering how recommendation system in general worked in the backend? Is it random or is there some sort of mechanism that shows us objects that we seems to like quite a lot? What happens when you have logged in for the first time? Will it adapt to our choices? Does customer's review really make a difference? To answer these questions, I thought why not build a Recommendation system myself?
 
So I will try to make a recommendation system for restaurants using collaborative filtering (CF) using the Yelp Dataset for this.
